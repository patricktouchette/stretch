# About

This is app is designed to get me to do my stretching exercises regularly.

### How to Use?

To start, I choose which routine I would like to do. A routine is a set of exercises. A timer shows me how long to hold the stretch. Once the timer is down to 0, it presents the next exercise in the list. I can also view the list of exercises and skip to a selected exercise.

### Why?

I have a tendency to forget to stretch. Also, the streching routine suggested by my physiotherapist quickly got out of hand. I find it too complicated to keep track of the whole routine and counting down time.

For example: I have 5 stretches (tricep, bicep, wrist flexor, wrist extensor, neck), which I should do on both sides for 30 seconds, repeat that 3 times, and alternate between stretches. The result is a fancy sequence. I just want to strech and be told what to do so my mind can be free to wander/figure out why my code is broken.

### The Result

To solve this problem, I coded this simple app using React.js with some styling using plain old CSS. You can see the code on github. I use JSON files for to hold the exercises data, and another to hold the sequences of exercises. This lets me avoid using a database, though it makes the app pretty much only useful to me. Which I am ok with.
